# PHSX815_Project3

This repository contains the code that estimates the decay rate parameter of a muon decay process. The data is simulated using exponential random sampling. 

## Issues with the Code

I don't think I clearly understood the Loglikehood concept. I have created some smaple data. `Parameter_Estimation.py` runs the optimization on it. But I keep getting wrong estimation. Please look at my code and let me know what is wrong with it. I used the same process I used in HW8, but it doesn't really make sense.
